# Loading a program, one definition at a time

{name}`Geb.Kernel.load` checks and evaluates a program's definitions in order, each in the
globals the definitions before it load. This module states the loading as a fold of one step
({lit}`loadStep`), so that a program's loading can be proved one definition at a time, and reads
a definition's meaning off a step that appends its global.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`loadStep` — the step of loading a program.
* {lit}`defType` — the type of a definition in the globals before it.

## Main statements

* {lit}`load_eq_foldl` — loading a program is the fold of its step.
* {lit}`infer_of_loadStep` — a definition that loads has a meaning at its global's type.
