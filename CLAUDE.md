## Audience

This file binds Claude Code. It supplements
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md),
which apply to every contributor and every AI agent
respectively; the rules below are the Claude-specific additions.

@AGENTS.md
@CONTRIBUTING.md

## Rules

- **No raw mutating `git` subcommands.** The PreToolUse hook at
  `scripts/hooks/block-mutating-git.sh` is an allow-list of read-only
  forms; mutating forms (and unknown forms) trigger a permission
  prompt. Use `jj` for state-mutating operations.
- `.remember/*.md` must be markdownlint-clean; clean up after each
  `remember`-skill invocation (the plugin emits non-clean markdown).
  Rationale and operational details: see `docs/process.md`
  § Markdownlint discipline.

## Phase-driven workflow

| Phase | Always-on skill | Helper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brainstorming | `superpowers:brainstorming` | `sequential-thinking`; Lean helpers as needed |
| Writing-plan | `superpowers:writing-plans` | `sequential-thinking`; Lean helpers as needed |
| Executing-plan | `superpowers:executing-plans` (or `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`) | phase-relevant Lean skills |
| Lean code work | `lean4` umbrella (sub-skills below) | `lean-lsp`, `serena` MCPs |
| Mathlib search | `lean-lsp` (`leansearch`, `loogle`, `local_search`, `hammer_premise`) | — |
| Pre-commit | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` | — |
| Receiving review | `superpowers:receiving-code-review` | — |

`lean4` sub-skill mapping by activity (drafting, proving, filling
`sorry`, golfing, porting, review, exploration, diagnosis,
checkpointing) lives in `.claude/rules/lean-coding-claude.md`
§ `lean4` sub-skill mapping.

The `superpowers` brainstorming, writing-plans, and
executing-plans skills write spec and plan files under
`docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` and leave
them in the working tree. Those files are spec and plan documents
like any other: the lifespan rules in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § Concern shape apply, so remove
them in the final commits of the topic branch.

## Tooling

- Skills: `superpowers:*`, `lean4:*`, `claude-md-management:*`,
  `code-review:*`, `pr-review-toolkit:*`, `commit-commands:*`,
  `security-review`; plus `dispatching-parallel-agents`,
  `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `remember`,
  `session-report`, `fewer-permission-prompts`,
  `claude-automation-recommender` (one-shot).

## When to consider creating a project-specific skill

If recurring patterns accumulate that don't fit `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/process.md`, `docs/rules/*.md`,
or existing `.claude/rules/*.md`, use
`skill-creator:skill-creator` to generate a `geb-development`
skill. Default is to wait for friction.
