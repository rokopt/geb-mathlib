## In progress

(None — bootstrap complete.)

## Next up

### Validate `PresheafPFunctor.functor` as a parametric right adjoint

Establish the natural isomorphism confirming that `PresheafPFunctor.functor`
is the parametric right adjoint determined by its generic data `(T1, E_T)`.

### Slice and presheaf W-types

Define the initial algebras (W-types) for slice and presheaf polynomial
functors as subtypes of mathlib's `PFunctor.W`.

### Free monads over the cslib monad construction

Build free monads over presheaf polynomial functors using cslib's monad
construction.

## Triggers (do when condition fires)

- **Slice polynomial functor natural isomorphism**: when a
  constructive (computable) `Type`-is-locally-cartesian-closed
  structure is available, in mathlib or built here, establish the
  natural isomorphism between `SlicePFunctor.functor` and the
  categorical composite `Σ_t ∘ Π_f ∘ Δ_s`.
- **Update `Authors:` lines as content authors arrive**: every
  `.lean` file ships with `Authors: The geb-mathlib contributors`.
  When a contributor authors substantive content in a file,
  update that file's `Authors:` line to credit them by name.
- **Adopt `leanprover-community/upstreaming-dashboard-action`**:
  when we judge we have enough novel and interesting content that
  members of the mathlib community would likely want to be made
  aware of the project — a standing question, revisited as content
  grows. Then add the action to CI plus a Pages-published
  dashboard following FLT's pattern.
- **`downstream-reports` registration**: a manual periodic
  checkpoint by the user. Trigger: "do we have enough substantive
  content that registration would be informative for the
  community, given the daily Zulip notification cost?" The pipeline
  and its trigger are described in `docs/process.md` § LKG/FKB
  pipeline.
- **Verso adoption** (three scopes with distinct gates; doc-gen4
  and Verso are complementary, not alternatives — doc-gen4
  generates the API reference, Verso authors hand-written prose):
  1. Docstrings in `.lean` files: gated on doc-gen4 gaining
     Verso-aware rendering and mathlib migrating to Verso;
     contraindicated for `Geb/Mathlib/` and `Geb/Cslib/` until
     both hold (Verso-markup docstrings would read as foreign to
     mathlib reviewers and would not render on the doc-gen4 site).
  2. Persistent prose (`docs/`, a future Geb-language exposition):
     gated on the prose growing substantial and describing stable,
     existing code. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
     `docs/process.md`, and `docs/rules/*` remain Markdown
     regardless (GitHub rendering, tool and `@import` consumption,
     markdownlint, doctoc).
  3. Transient design docs on feature branches: no external gate;
     candidate for a local-only Verso build to evaluate authoring
     ergonomics and type-checking of embedded Lean.

  Currently using Markdown rendered by doc-gen4. A local pilot
  (2026-07-02) validated the mechanism: Verso and mathlib coexist in
  one lake project at v4.32.0-rc1, embedded Lean type-checks (a
  mismatch fails the build with a locatable error), and
  within-document references resolve. Two follow-up workstreams, each
  its own spec/plan cycle when taken up:
  - Persistent Geb-language exposition seed chapter in Verso
    (scope 2), once exposition-worthy prose exists.
  - Verso for transient feature-branch design docs (scope 3); a
    change to the current Markdown-based brainstorming and
    writing-plans flow, so it needs its own scoping.
- **Project-specific `geb-development` skill**: when recurring
  patterns accumulate that fit neither `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/process.md`,
  `docs/rules/*.md`, nor existing `.claude/rules/*.md`. Default
  is to wait for friction.
- **Author `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` for our repo**:
  trigger when the first PR against our own repo is opened (most
  likely the bump-PR cron).
- **Curated `notes` / `journal` directory**: trigger if recurring
  ad-hoc explorations accumulate that don't fit `docs/`.
- **Migrate `update.yml` from `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a PAT**: trigger
  if the manual close-and-reopen-to-fire-CI overhead on cron-
  created bump-PRs becomes burdensome.
