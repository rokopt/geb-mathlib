# Expression combinators and the scan at a linear growth bound

`Cobham.scan` admits a state exceeding the input by an additive constant:
its bound child prepends `growth` bits to the recursion variable, so the
recursion bound reads `|state| ≤ |w| + growth`. A fold whose state carries one
`(p + 1)`-bit block per pending subterm can exceed that, the block count rising
once per `R.width` input bits. `R.width < p + 1` is necessary for it to do so,
not sufficient: an alphabet whose symbols never grow the stack keeps the state
bounded whatever the carrier. At `R.width ≥ p + 1` the additive bound always
suffices, and `Geb.CobhamFold.length_stateWordF_not_le_add` exhibits the failure
at the two-symbol alphabet, whose width is one.

This module supplies the bound child `boundMulRaw`, built over `multRaw`, whose
value is the `mult`-fold self-concatenation of the recursion variable, and the
scan combinator
`scanBRaw` parameterized by its bound child, so that `Cobham.scan`'s additive
bound and the multiplicative bound `mult * |w| + growth` are two instances of
one node. It also supplies the general expression combinators — a projection, two
compositions and a concatenation — and the scan node `scan2Raw` at steps of
arity two. Both fold constructions over this one reach `scan2Raw`, through
`scanBRaw`, and the fixed-width one uses `comp1Of` besides; the projection, the
general composition and the concatenation reach the bitstring construction
alone.

The multiplier is built from `Cobham.concatCompRaw`, whose head is the `concat`
generator. `concat` belongs to the subalgebra `Cobham.SmashFree` names, which
[Strahm2003] Theorem 1(2) contains in the functions computable simultaneously
in polynomial time and linear space, so the multiplicative bound stays inside
that subalgebra; `Geb.CobhamFold.smashFreeBool_boundMulRaw` states this at
every multiplicity and growth.
`Cobham.cond` already takes a concatenation bound in place of
[HeraudNowak2011]'s smash bound for the same reason.

## Main definitions

* `Geb.CobhamFold.projOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.compOf`, `Geb.CobhamFold.comp1Of`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.concatCompOf` — a projection, a composition, an arity-one
  expression applied to an expression, and a concatenation, as expressions.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.multRaw` — the `mult`-fold self-concatenation of the
  recursion variable.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.boundMulRaw` — that concatenation with `growth` bits
  prepended.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.scan2Raw` — the scan node at steps of arity two, which read
  the remaining word as well as the recursive value.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.scanBRaw`, `Geb.CobhamFold.scanBW` — that node at two steps
  lifted from arity one, which is `Cobham.scan`'s shape, and it over
  expressions.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.scanBSem` — the meaning of that node at arity one.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.scanMul`, `Geb.CobhamFold.scanMulOf` — the scan at the
  multiplicative bound, as an expression of `Cobham.C` and at its declared
  arity.

## Main statements

* `Geb.CobhamFold.wValid_concatCompRaw`, `Geb.CobhamFold.recBounded_concatCompRaw`
  — admissibility and the recursion bound of a concatenation node, from its
  two arguments'.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.length_multSem` — the multiplier's value has length
  `mult * |x 0|`, exactly.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.length_boundMulSem` — the bound child's value has length
  `growth + mult * |x 0|`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.scanBRaw_boundRaw` — at the additive bound child the
  parameterized node is `Cobham.scanRaw`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.boundMulRaw_ne_boundRaw` — at the multiplier one, the
  multiplicative bound child is not the additive one, at any growth.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.scanBSem_nil`, `Geb.CobhamFold.scanBSem_cons`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.scanBSem_eq` — the scan on the empty word, on one bit, and as
  a `List.foldr`, at every bound child.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.scanMulSem_eq_eval` — the meaning read at the raw tree is the
  meaning the expression carries.

## Implementation notes

`Cobham.concatCompRaw n a b` evaluates to `b`'s list followed by `a`'s, the
`concat` generator reading its second argument as the earlier part of the word.
`multRaw`'s step therefore places the projection second, so the recursion
variable is prepended at each level; the value is a concatenation of copies of
one list, so the order is immaterial and only `length_multSem` is stated.

`scanBRaw` differs from `Cobham.scanRaw` only in taking its bound child as a
parameter rather than building it from a growth. Every statement about the
scan's value — `scanBSem_nil`, `scanBSem_cons`, `scanBSem_eq` — holds at every
bound child, `Cobham.evalValue`'s `boundedRec` clause not consulting child
three; only the recursion bound reads it.

The transports `Cobham.semAt` introduces disappear here by proof irrelevance:
each raw tree whose meaning is read here is a `WType.mk` whose shape's
`Cobham.q` reduces to `1`, so the arity equation has definitionally equal
sides.
