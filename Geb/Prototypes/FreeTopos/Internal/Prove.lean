# A prover for the internal language

A prover, prototyped in Lean, that computes derivations the checker
{name}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.check` checks. It normalizes a term innermost first: it
normalizes the children, each in its own context, then applies at the root the first rule of a
list that applies, and normalizes the result; or weak head normal forms first, an argument used
more than once reduced before it is substituted, so that its value is computed once, and a case
analysis's branches reduced only once one is selected, to a weak normal form, which leaves the
bodies of abstractions and the starts and steps of folds, to a normal form but for folds' starts
and steps, or to the normal form. The rules are the language's equations, the unfolding of the
definitions below an index, a variable of the terminal type as its element, the earlier
theorems, whose instances it finds by matching their left sides, and the hypotheses; a rule is
tried again at a node whose children a reduction rewrote.
It proves an equation by normalizing both sides to one term, by induction on the innermost
variable with a step it is given, and by induction on a rose tree in the form of the uniqueness
of its fold, each premise by normalization; with the induction hypothesis, it normalizes the
hypothesis, cuts in the normal form, and rewrites the step by it. Proofs compose: an equation of
functions by extensionality, an equation by case analysis of a variable of a coproduct anywhere
in the context, and list induction whose premises other proofs prove. The prover is not
trusted: a derivation it computes is checked.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`NormRule` — a rule the normalizer applies at a term's root.
* {lit}`tryRule`, {lit}`rootRewrite` — the rewriting of a term at its root by one rule, and by
  the first of a list that applies.
* {lit}`prepareRule`, {lit}`prepareRules` — the rules with each theorem's matching prepared
  once.
* {lit}`normStep` — one step of the normalization innermost first.
* {lit}`normalize` — the normal form of a term and its rewriting derivation.
* {lit}`byNorm`, {lit}`byNatInd`, {lit}`byListInd`, {lit}`byNatIndHyp`, {lit}`byListIndHyp`,
  {lit}`byRoseInd`, {lit}`byNormW` — the proofs of an equation.
* {lit}`byFunExt`, {lit}`bySplit`, {lit}`byListIndWith`, {lit}`byRoseIndHyp` — the proofs of an
  equation from proofs of others: of functions by extensionality, by case analysis of a variable
  of a coproduct anywhere in the context, and by list induction and rose-tree induction with each
  premise proved by a prover.
* {lit}`Depth`, {lit}`eval`, {lit}`whnf`, {lit}`normalizeW` — the depths of reduction, the
  reduction to a depth, sharing an argument's value among its uses, the weak head normal form,
  and the normal form reached through it.
* {lit}`atRoot`, {lit}`headStep`, {lit}`deepStep`, {lit}`evalStep` — the steps of the reduction
  to a depth: the rewriting at the root, the weak head normal form, and the reduction past it.
