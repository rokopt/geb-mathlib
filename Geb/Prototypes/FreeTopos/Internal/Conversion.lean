# The checker with a step of conversion

A checker of the internal language beside {name}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.check`, whose
certificates add to the language's rules a step of conversion: the rewriting of a term to its
normal form under named rules, those of the prover's normalization
({name}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.NormRule`). The base checker does not compute that conversion; it
checks each step of it in a derivation. The conversion checker computes it, and admits it by its
translation: a step of conversion at a term in a context under hypotheses is the rewriting
derivation of the prover's normalization of the term under the named rules
({name}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.normalize`), and its rewriting is the base checker's rewriting by
that derivation. At every other node the conversion checker takes the base checker's step. Its
soundness is therefore relative to the base checker's, a stronger checker admitted beside a weaker
one by the translation of its certificates ({cite}`Davis2009`): each step of conversion by the
soundness of the base checker ({name}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.check_sound`), and each other node by
the soundness of the base checker's step ({name}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.checkStep_sound`). The
normalization is not trusted: the derivation it computes is checked. A step of conversion carries
the bound on the depth of the normalization.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`ConvRule`, {lit}`ConvDeriv` — the rules of the conversion checker's certificates, and
  its certificates.
* {lit}`convCheck`, {lit}`Thm.convChecks` — the conversion checker, and the test that a
  certificate proves a theorem.

## Main statements

* {lit}`convCheck_sound` — the conversion checker is sound.
* {lit}`Thm.valid_of_convChecks` — a theorem a certificate proves with valid earlier entries is
  valid.

## References

* {cite}`Davis2009`, Chapter 1, for checkers admitted by relative soundness.
