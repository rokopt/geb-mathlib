# Tactics of the internal language

Provers of the internal language's equations composed from the prover
({name}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.byNorm` and the provers beside it): proofs by reduction, by
induction and case analysis, with hypotheses, by search, and about the translation's trees. The
proofs about the compiler's components made in the language compose them.
