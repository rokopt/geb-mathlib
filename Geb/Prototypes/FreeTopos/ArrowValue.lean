# The value of an arrow term with a domain and a codomain

In the topos of types and functional relations, a term whose domain and codomain are defined
and are the values of two object terms, types, has a value, a functional relation between those
types: the operations are strict, so the term is defined where its domain is, and the domain
and the codomain of an arrow's value are the types it relates. The typing of a term of the
internal language gives the hypotheses, as equations valid in every model of the theory
({lit}`Geb.FreeTopos.Internal.hom_unfoldAll_of_compile`).

## Main statements

* {lit}`exists_arrVal_of_dom_cod` — a term with a domain and a codomain has a functional
  relation between them as its value.
