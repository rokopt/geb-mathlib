# The judgments of canonical LF

The formation judgments of Canonical LF ({cite}`HarperLicata2007`, Section 2.2, Figures 2 and 3),
with the subordination relation the complete one, so that it restricts nothing. They are
bidirectional and directed by the syntax, so that each is decided by a fold over the expression it
classifies, one clause for each rule:

* {lit}`Γ ⊢ K kind`: {lit}`type` is a kind (canon kind type), and {lit}`Π x:A. K` is one when
  {lit}`A` is a type and {lit}`K` a kind in the extended context (canon kind pi);
* {lit}`Γ ⊢ A type`: {lit}`Π x:A₂. A` is a type when {lit}`A₂` is one and {lit}`A` is one in the
  extended context (canon fam pi), and an atomic family is one when its kind is {lit}`type`
  (canon fam atom);
* {lit}`Γ ⊢ P ⇒ K`: the kind of an atomic family is its constant's kind, instantiated at its
  arguments by hereditary substitution (atom fam const, atom fam app);
* {lit}`Γ ⊢ M ⇐ A`: an abstraction checks against a product when its body checks against the
  codomain in the extended context (canon term lam), and an atomic term checks against an atomic
  type, and only against one, when it synthesizes that type (canon term atom), so that the terms
  that check are η-long;
* {lit}`Γ ⊢ R ⇒ A`: the type of an atomic term is its head's, a variable's from the context and a
  constant's from the signature, instantiated at its arguments, each checked against the domain
  it meets, by hereditary substitution (atom term var, atom term const, atom term app).

An application is a head with its spine, so that the rules atom fam app and atom term app,
applied once per argument, are one pass along the spine ({lit}`spine`). Types are compared as
expressions: canonical forms are unique, so that no other equality is needed. The rules for
contexts and signatures (Figure 2) check each declaration in the scope of those before it.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`Mode` — the three judgments that check an expression.
* {lit}`classOf`, {lit}`spine` — the classifier of a head, and its instantiation along a spine.
* {lit}`judge` — the fold deciding the judgments.
* {lit}`IsKind`, {lit}`IsType`, {lit}`Checks` — the judgments.
* {lit}`Ctx.ok`, {lit}`Sig.ok` — the formation of contexts and signatures.
