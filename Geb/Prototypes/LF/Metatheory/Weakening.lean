# Weakening

The judgments of canonical LF are stable under renaming ({cite}`HarperLicata2007`, Lemmas 2.6
and 2.7, weakening and exchange, in de Bruijn form): an expression judged in a context is judged,
renamed, in any context into which the renaming maps each variable to one of the renamed type
({lit}`CtxRen`). Weakening by a variable is the renaming by the successor into the extended
context ({lit}`CtxRen.succ`). The constants of the signature are taken closed, so that renaming
leaves their kinds and types in place.

The instantiation of a classifier along a spine commutes with renaming ({lit}`spine_rename`),
by the commutation of hereditary substitution with renaming ({name}`Geb.LF.hsub_rename`) and the
invariance of erasure ({name}`Geb.LF.erase_rename`); the judgments then by induction on the
expression ({lit}`judge_rename`).

## Main definitions

* {lit}`Mode.rename` — the renaming of the type a mode checks against.
* {lit}`CtxRen` — a renaming between contexts that respects the variables' types.
* {lit}`SigClosed` — the kinds and types of the constants are closed.

## Main statements

* {lit}`CtxRen.lift`, {lit}`CtxRen.succ` — renamings under a binder, and weakening.
* {lit}`spine_rename` — the instantiation along a spine commutes with renaming.
* {lit}`judgeWith_rename`, {lit}`judge_rename` — the judgments are stable under renaming.
* {lit}`judge_shift` — weakening by a variable.
