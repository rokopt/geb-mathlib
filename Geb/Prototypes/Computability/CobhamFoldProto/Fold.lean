# The fold scan of a preorder spelling

`RankedAlphabet.scanStep` reads a preorder spelling right to left, carrying an
incomplete block, a count of pending subterms and a liveness flag. At a
completed block the symbol pops its arity from the count and pushes one, so the
count is the height of a stack whose entries carry no data.

This module replaces that count by a stack of values of an arbitrary carrier
and the pop-push by an application of an algebra of the ranked alphabet.
`toScan` projects the resulting state onto `RankedAlphabet.Scan` by taking the
stack's length, and `toScan_foldScanStep` shows the projection is a step
homomorphism at every carrier and every algebra: the validity scan is the
image of the fold scan under the terminal map, not a separate construction.

`foldOut` reads the final state as an `Option`, absent exactly where the word
spells no term, and `foldOut_eq` identifies it with `RankedAlphabet.parse`
followed by the fold. `R.Term` is the initial algebra of the alphabet, so that
fold is the unique algebra morphism out of it.

## Main definitions

* `Geb.CobhamFold.symOf` — the symbol a block denotes, refining
  `RankedAlphabet.arOf`, which returns only its arity.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.Term.fold` — the unique algebra morphism out of the term
  algebra.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.FoldScan` — the fold scan's state.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldScanStep`, `Geb.CobhamFold.foldScanFrom`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.foldScanFinal` — one step, the scan from a state, and the
  scan from the initial state.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.toScan` — the projection onto `RankedAlphabet.Scan`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOut` — the final state read as an `Option`.

## Main statements

* `Geb.CobhamFold.arOf_eq_map_symOf` — `RankedAlphabet.arOf` is `symOf`
  followed by the arity.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.toScan_foldScanStep`, `Geb.CobhamFold.toScan_foldScanFinal` —
  the projection is a step homomorphism, and carries the whole scan.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.mem_stack_foldScanFinal` — every value on the scan's stack
  is one the algebra produced.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldScanFrom_code` — a completed block pops its arity's worth
  of stack and pushes the algebra applied to them.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldScanFrom_ofFn` — a family of spellings pushes one value
  each, in index order.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldScanFrom_spell` — a spelling pushes one value, the fold
  of the term it spells.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.Term.fold_unique` — the term algebra is initial, so `Term.fold`
  is the algebra morphism out of it rather than one of several.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.Term.fold_map`, `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOut_map` — fold fusion,
  and the agreement of two folds at different carriers whose algebras commute
  with a map.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.foldOut_eq` — the fold scan computes `RankedAlphabet.parse`
  followed by `Term.fold`.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.buf_foldScanFinal`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.length_stack_foldScanFinal`,
  `Geb.CobhamFold.length_buf_foldScanFinal_lt` — the projection's consequences
  for the incomplete block and the stack's height, which every state layout over
  this scan consumes.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.width_mul_depth_add_length_buf_scanFinal_le` — the sharper
  bound on the pending count: the alphabet's width times the count, plus the
  incomplete block, is at most the word's length.
* `Geb.CobhamFold.width_mul_depth_scanFinal_le` — its corollary dropping the
  incomplete block, `R.width * depth ≤ |w|`.

## Implementation notes

The stack's head is the value of the term spelled immediately to the right of
the symbol being read, which is that symbol's child zero: scanning right to
left, `RankedAlphabet.scanFrom_append` reads the later part of a word first, so
within a symbol's children the last one scanned — and so the one pushed last —
is child zero. `foldScanStep` therefore indexes the algebra's argument by
position in the stack directly.

`foldScanStep` branches by `dite` where `RankedAlphabet.scanStep` branches by a
`match` on `decide`: the arity branch needs the comparison's proof to index the
stack, which a `match` on a `Bool` does not supply.

`symOf` is what `RankedAlphabet.arOf` would be if the scan needed the symbol
rather than its arity; `arOf_eq_map_symOf` is what makes the two scans branch
alike, and so what `toScan_foldScanStep` rests on.

`width_mul_depth_add_length_buf_scanFinal_le` sharpens
`RankedAlphabet.depth_scanFinal_le_length` by the alphabet's width. The pending
count rises only at a completed block, so it counts symbols rather than bits.
The invariant carries the incomplete block's length because a partial block is
progress toward the next increment; without that summand the induction does not
close at the completing step. `omega` treats the products as atoms, so the
completing step supplies the two linear facts relating them.
