# Decorated rose trees

A decorated rose tree carries at each node a decoration beside its label: it is the rose tree
over pairs of a decoration and a label. Over a fixed type of labels, decorated trees form the
cofree recursive comonad on the rose functor {cite}`UustaluVene2011`: the counit
{lit}`extract` reads the decoration at the root, and redecoration {lit}`redecorate`
replaces each node's decoration by a function of the subtree below the node, the
comultiplication being redecoration by the identity. Every annotation of source is such a
decoration, comments and the empty lines between items among them, so one mechanism computes
each decoration from another.

The decorated tree is finite, the initial algebra of the functor of a decoration paired with a
rose node, not the terminal coalgebra that the cofree comonad is in general; the laws are
therefore stated and proved concretely, by induction over nodes.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`RoseTree.Decorated` — rose trees over pairs of a decoration and a label.
* {lit}`RoseTree.extract` — the decoration at the root, the counit.
* {lit}`RoseTree.redecorate` — each node's decoration replaced by a function of its subtree.
* {lit}`RoseTree.erase` — the labels alone, every decoration forgotten.

## Main statements

* {lit}`RoseTree.extract_redecorate`, {lit}`RoseTree.redecorate_extract`,
  {lit}`RoseTree.redecorate_redecorate` — the laws of the comonad, in the form of its
  extension.
* {lit}`RoseTree.erase_redecorate` — redecoration leaves the labels unchanged.

## References

* {cite}`UustaluVene2011` — the cofree recursive comonad and its recursion scheme.
