# First-order unification of rose trees

Rose trees over the labels {lit}`α ⊕ ℕ` are first-order terms with metavariables: a node
labelled {lit}`Sum.inr x` is the metavariable {lit}`x`, and every other node a function symbol
applied to its children. A substitution assigns trees to metavariables, and a unifier of a
list of equations is a substitution making the two sides of each equal. Robinson's algorithm
{cite}`Robinson1965` finds a most general unifier of a unifiable list and fails on any other: it
removes an equation whose sides are equal, binds a metavariable to the other side unless it
occurs there, decomposes an equation between nodes of one label and arity into the equations
of their children, and fails at nodes of different labels or arities.

The algorithm is a step function on a state of the substitution found and the equations that
remain, iterated within a budget of steps. A state that has not finished when the budget is
spent is reported as exhausted, distinct from a failure to unify.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`Meta`, {lit}`mvar`, {lit}`embed` — trees with metavariables, a metavariable, and the
  embedding of trees without them.
* {lit}`substM`, {lit}`occurs`, {lit}`ground` — substitution, the occurs check, and the
  instantiation of every remaining metavariable by one tree.
* {lit}`Unifier`, {lit}`unifyStep` — the state of the algorithm and its step.
* {lit}`Unified`, {lit}`unify` — the outcome of the algorithm within a budget.

## Main statements

* {lit}`substM_embed` — a substitution leaves a tree without metavariables unchanged.
* {lit}`ground_embed` — instantiation recovers a tree without metavariables.

## Implementation notes

The substitution is kept idempotent: a metavariable is bound to a tree to which the
substitution has been applied and in which it does not occur, and the binding is applied to the
earlier bindings, so that one application of the substitution reaches every assigned
metavariable. Each equation is substituted when it is taken from the list.
