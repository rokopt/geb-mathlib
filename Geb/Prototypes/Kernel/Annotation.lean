# Annotations of identifiers

Annotations of a bundle's definitions are kept apart from their payloads, in a table keyed by a
definition and a vertex of its term, the path of child positions from the root. A definition is
first its position in the bundle; the migration to identifiers ({lit}`Geb.Kernel.Identity.migrate`)
relabels the leaves of references and moves no vertex ({lit}`migrate_shape`), so a key re-keyed
to the identifier of the definition's payload and the same vertex
({lit}`rekey`) addresses the same node of the payload's body ({lit}`valid_rekey`). Names are
such annotations: the name a definition is declared under, at the root of its term, and the
name written at each reference, at the reference's vertex ({lit}`nameNotes`). The table is a
relation: definitions with equal payloads share an identifier and keep each its own notes.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`subtree?` — the subtree at a vertex.
* {lit}`refVertices` — the vertices of a term's references to definitions.
* {lit}`Note`, {lit}`nameNotes` — names as annotations.
* {lit}`rekey` — a table keyed by positions re-keyed by identifiers.

## Main statements

* {lit}`migrate_shape` — the migration moves no vertex.
* {lit}`valid_rekey` — re-keyed keys address nodes of the payloads they name.
