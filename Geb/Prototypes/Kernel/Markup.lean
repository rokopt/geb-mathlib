# The markup of comments

The prose of a source document's comments is written in a recorded subset of Verso's markup, the
format of prose that a durable document's profile names ({name}`Geb.Kernel.Document.Profile`),
version {lit}`0` of {lit}`verso`. A block of comment lines, the lines between two empty lines of
the source, is one text of prose: each line's characters after its semicolon and one space, the
lines joined by line breaks. The subset is what a parser can read without guessing, and Verso's
own parser reads each text the subset admits to the same structure, which the tests check
against the parser of Lean's documentation strings.

The blocks of the subset are paragraphs and code blocks. A paragraph is a run of non-empty lines,
none beginning or ending with a space or beginning with an opener of another of Verso's blocks,
and its first line not beginning with {lit}`#`; paragraphs are separated by empty lines. A code
block is a line of three backticks, the lines of its code, none holding three backticks in a row,
and a line of three backticks. The
inline content of a paragraph's line is text, code, and code under a role: a character other than
{lit}`\`, the backtick, the braces, the brackets, {lit}`*` and {lit}`_` is text, as is any
character after {lit}`\`; a dollar sign is not followed by a backtick, which would begin
mathematics; code is a span between single backticks of characters other than the backtick, not
empty and neither beginning nor ending with a space; and a role is one of the four names
{lit}`name`, {lit}`geb`, {lit}`cite` and {lit}`lit` between braces, followed by code.

The roles are those the repository's literate Lean modules use, and one for Geb: {lit}`name`
refers to a Lean constant, {lit}`geb` to a definition of the program, {lit}`cite` to an entry of
the bibliography, and {lit}`lit` marks code that refers to nothing. A reference to a Geb
definition resolves as a qualified name of Lean resolves in its namespaces: in a comment inside
the modules {lit}`M₁ … Mₖ`, the name {lit}`x` refers to the first of {lit}`M₁.….Mₖ.x`, …,
{lit}`M₁.x` and {lit}`x` that the program declares. The notes' links
({name}`Geb.Kernel.Document.Field`) resolve alike, at the scope of the declaration they document.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`Role`, {lit}`Inline`, {lit}`Block` — the roles, inline content and blocks of the subset.
* {lit}`parseLine`, {lit}`parseProse` — a line's inline content, and the blocks of a text.
* {lit}`sitesOf` — the blocks of comments of a document, each with the scope it is written in.
* {lit}`declsOf` — the paths of the declarations of a document.
* {lit}`Resolver`, {lit}`check` — what resolves a reference outside the program, and the check of
  a document's comments and notes against its program's declarations.
