# Checking a program with holes

A hole is the form {lit}`(hole name)`, written {lit}`?name`, at the position of a term. A hole
of a program stands for a term in the context of its declaring occurrence, the first in the
program's order, whose binders are its context: a hole is a metavariable of contextual modal
type theory {cite}`NanevskiPfenningPientka2008`, whose occurrences carry explicit substitutions
from its context. Every occurrence of a named hole is one obligation, and an occurrence elsewhere
than the declaring one substitutes, for each variable of the hole's context, the variable of the
same name in its own scope.

The checker lifts the holes out of the program. The occurrence of a hole whose context binds
{lit}`x₁ … xₖ`, the outermost first, becomes the application {lit}`(?name x₁ … xₖ)` of a
variable bound around every definition, so that the hole stands for a function of its context,
and the kernel's resolution of names makes each definition a kernel term in which the holes are
the outermost free variables. A hole's expected type is a metavariable, and its variable's type
the function type from its context's types to it. The typing of the kernel's terms is then a
list of equations between types, solved by unification {cite}`Wand1987`
{cite}`Robinson1965`: each application, projection, conditional and list a term builds requires
an equation, and a definition's type is a type with metavariables, which the definitions after it
constrain further. The equations that mention a hole's metavariable are the checks its unknown
filling suspends, and their solution is the hole's goal.

A program is accepted with its holes when the equations unify within a budget of steps and its
completion loads: each hole replaced by the closure over its context of a term of its expected
type, each remaining metavariable read as {lit}`T`, and the program checked by
{name}`Geb.Kernel.load`, the trusted checker, which this module leaves unchanged. Every accepted
program therefore has a completion that the kernel accepts, so the holes it reports are
obligations that can be met: a program with holes is accepted only when its lambda-lifting checks
at some types of its holes. That every such program is accepted is the completeness of the
unification, which is tested and not proved. A program without holes is its own completion, and
is reported as complete; a program with an open hole is not.

A hole is filled by substituting, for its variable, the closure over its context of a term
written there, so that the term's names are resolved in the hole's context and no binder around
an occurrence captures them; the program filled is checked again.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`Scope`, {lit}`Decl` — the binders around a position, and a hole with its context.
* {lit}`occStep`, {lit}`liftStep` — the search for holes and the lifting of their occurrences.
* {lit}`gen` — the equations of a term's typing, with metavariables for the types the kernel's
  terms do not annotate.
* {lit}`dflt`, {lit}`closure`, {lit}`completeTerm` — a term of each type, the closure of a term
  over a context, and the replacement of a program's holes by closures.
* {lit}`Lifted`, {lit}`liftProgram` — a program with its holes lifted.
* {lit}`unifyDefs` — the unification of each definition's equations in turn.
* {lit}`Hole`, {lit}`Report`, {lit}`obligationsOf`, {lit}`check` — the obligations of a
  program and their check.
* {lit}`fillAt`, {lit}`fill` — the substitution of a term for a hole's variable, and the filling
  of a lifted program's hole by a term written in its context.
* {lit}`Report.render` — the display of the obligations, a hole as {lit}`?name` and a type
  that no equation determines with its metavariables, each {lit}`(meta i)`.

## Main statements

* {lit}`load_completion` — the completion of every accepted program loads.
* {lit}`infer_fillAt`, {lit}`infer_fillAt_closed` — a filled term denotes the term at the
  filling's value, and a closed filling captures no variable.

## Implementation notes

The work the holes suspend is the list of equations, a finite list of items each of which
unification resumes as the metavariables it mentions are assigned, within a budget whose
exhaustion is reported apart from ill-typing. The equations are unified a definition at a time,
continuing from the substitution of those before it, so that a program's rejection names the
first definition whose equations do not unify. The kernel's types are simple, so the type at a
hole's position never depends on the term that fills it, and no check suspended on a hole is more
than an equation between types.

A hole's name lifted is {lit}`?name`, which no name the reader reads begins with, since
{lit}`?` begins the token of a hole; the checker rejects a program naming a binder or a
definition by a quoted atom beginning with {lit}`?`, which would capture a lifted hole.
