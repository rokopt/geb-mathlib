# Modules

A pass before reading flattens a program's modules into declarations under qualified names.
A module is a block form, {lit}`(module M header… body…)`, whose header is a telescope of
parameters and imports followed by an export list. A module without parameters is elaborated
where it is declared: each declaration of its body under the name {lit}`M.x`, qualified by the
module's path from the root, the rest of the enclosing block referring to its exports as
{lit}`M.x`. An import {lit}`(import P)` makes the exports of the module at path {lit}`P`
visible unqualified, and {lit}`(import P as N)` as {lit}`N.x`. A module with parameters is
elaborated at each import that supplies all of its parameters, {lit}`(import (P a …))`: a sort
parameter {lit}`(parameter A)` becomes a type abbreviation of its argument and an operation
parameter {lit}`(parameter (f (A …) R))` a definition of its argument at that type, and the body
is elaborated under the instance's prefix. Instantiation by definitions is substitution of the
arguments for the parameters, the kernel's types being monomorphic.

Every name of a declaration's body is renamed to what it denotes in the flat program, a name
bound around it in a term excepted; the forms of the kernel and of the datatype language give
each child its role, so a quoted datum and the name of a hole are never renamed. A name visible
in a block is never declared again in it, nor imported, nor bound by a parameter: a clash is
rejected, as are an import naming no module or leaving a parameter unsupplied and an export
naming nothing. A program without modules is unchanged.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`rename` — the renaming of an S-expression in a role.
* {lit}`expandModules` — the elaboration of a program's modules.
* {lit}`readProgram`, {lit}`runMain`, {lit}`diagnose` — the reading of a program through the
  elaboration of its modules.

## Implementation notes

The elaboration of a block is a fold over its forms; the elaboration of a nested module and of
an instance is one level of a tower built by {lit}`Nat.rec`, bounded by the number of module
forms in the program, since a module imports only modules declared before it.
