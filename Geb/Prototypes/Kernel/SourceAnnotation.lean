# Source annotations of kernel definitions

A document remains the authority for binder spellings and comments. A separate pass records
which source occurrences give rise to vertices of the kernel terms read by
{name}`Geb.Kernel.readForms`. An abstraction's binder names address its successive lambda
nodes; a let binder addresses the lambda in its application. Application arguments address
the corresponding nested applications. A quotation is data and supplies no binder names.

Addresses of source occurrences start with the index of a document item. Addresses of core
occurrences start with the index of a definition, followed by a vertex of its term. The table
is a relation: several source occurrences can address one core vertex. The complete document
also retains occurrences without a core address, including abbreviations and trailing prose.
Re-keying a core address by content identity leaves the source occurrence in the value of the
table, so equal definitions retain their distinct annotations.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`Origin` — a source occurrence and its role at a kernel vertex.
* {lit}`trace` — the correspondence for the kernel's term forms.
* {lit}`annotate` — the source, resolved definitions and validated correspondence.
* {lit}`Annotated.notesAt`, {lit}`Annotated.unattached` — attached source information and
  trivia without a core address.
* {lit}`Annotated.rekeyed` — annotations keyed by definition CID and vertex.
* {lit}`Annotated.write`, {lit}`read` — canonical records and their checked reading.

## Main statements

* {lit}`source_of_annotate`, {lit}`readForms_of_annotate` — source and core preservation.
* {lit}`definitions_eq_of_erase_eq` — source decorations do not change the core.
* {lit}`valid_rekeyed`, {lit}`rekeyed_sources` — valid addresses and preserved source
  occurrences after migration to content identity.
* {lit}`read_write` — the canonical record's retraction.

## Implementation notes

This pass operates on kernel declarations before any module or datatype elaboration. It does
not infer source occurrences from equal subtrees. Types and quoted data are retained in full
in the source document; the table addresses their roots, without expanding source addresses
through type abbreviations or the character encoding of quoted atoms.
