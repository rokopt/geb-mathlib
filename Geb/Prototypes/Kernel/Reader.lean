# The kernel's readable syntax

A program is a sequence of definitions written as S-expressions, {lit}`(def name term)`, each
term referring to the definitions before it by name, of type abbreviations
{lit}`(deftype name type)`, and of numeral abbreviations {lit}`(defnum name n)`, the
abbreviations each in force after it. A numeral abbreviation names a label, as an
assembler's symbolic constant does: the atoms of a definition's term that name one are read
as its numeral, wherever they occur. A declaration's name is neither a keyword, a primitive's
name nor a type's, nor the name of an earlier declaration of any kind. Reading has two stages:
a text in the authoring profile is read as S-expressions
({name}`Geb.Kernel.Document.readDoc`),
rose trees whose leaves carry atoms and whose other nodes are lists; each
S-expression is then resolved into a kernel term, variable names becoming de Bruijn indices,
definition names references, and keywords the kernel's constructors. Loading type-checks
and evaluates the definitions in order, each in the global environment of those before it.

The forms of a term:

* a numeral {lit}`n` is the quoted leaf of label {lit}`n`; {lit}`unit` is the unit value;
  a bound name is a variable, a defined name a reference, and a primitive's name the
  primitive;
* {lit}`(lam (x A) body)` is an abstraction binding {lit}`x` of type {lit}`A`, and
  {lit}`(lam ((x₁ A₁) … (xₙ Aₙ)) body)` the nested abstractions binding each in turn;
  {lit}`(let x A e body)` is the abstraction binding {lit}`x` in {lit}`body` applied to
  {lit}`e`;
  {lit}`(pair a b)`, {lit}`(fst p)`, {lit}`(snd p)`, {lit}`(if c a b)` and
  {lit}`(quote d)` are the corresponding constructors, a datum being a numeral or a list
  {lit}`(n d₁ … dₖ)` of a label and children, in which an atom that is not a numeral stands
  for the leaves of its characters' codes;
* {lit}`(nil A)` is the empty list of elements of type {lit}`A` and {lit}`(cons x xs)` the
  list of a head and a tail;
* {lit}`(fold A x₁ … xₖ)`, {lit}`(iter A x₁ … xₖ)`, {lit}`(foldr A B x₁ … xₖ)` and
  {lit}`(lcase A B x₁ … xₖ)` apply the fold of trees, the iteration, the right fold of lists
  and the case analysis of lists at the given types to their arguments, and any other list
  {lit}`(f x₁ … xₖ)` applies {lit}`f` to its arguments in turn.

Types are {lit}`T`, {lit}`Unit`, {lit}`(Prod A B)`, {lit}`(Arrow A B)`,
{lit}`(List A)` and the names of type abbreviations. A semicolon begins a comment that
extends to the end of its line, which the reading of a document keeps and the reading of a
program erases.

## Main definitions

* {lit}`readSExps` — the S-expressions of a text.
* {lit}`readDatum` — an S-expression read as a quoted datum.
* {lit}`reservedNames`, {lit}`isFresh` — the names a declaration may take.
* {lit}`expandNums` — the expansion of numeral abbreviations.
* {lit}`resolve` — the resolution of an S-expression into a kernel term.
* {lit}`readProgram`, {lit}`load` — a program's definitions as named terms, and their
  meanings.
* {lit}`runMain` — the application of a program's last definition to an input tree.
* {lit}`diagnose` — the first failure of a program that does not read or load.

## Implementation notes

Both stages are folds: the lexer and the parser of the source document fold over the text,
the parser with an explicit stack, and resolution is a fold over the S-expression whose
result is a function of the names in scope. Text is a list of characters and atoms are lists
of characters, compared with keywords through {name}`String.ofList`: core's
{lit}`String.toList`, and the numeral parser built on it, depend on {lit}`Classical.choice`,
which this module avoids.
