# Prototype: what the universe functor computes over a non-discrete base

Throwaway exploration, not upstream-eligible content. Every declaration here is
`Classical.choice`-free.

`Basic` builds the universe endofunctor over a base of finite sets with all
functions between them as morphisms. This module computes its value on a family
of codes and records what the computation shows.

A family of codes `(U, d : U → Card)` — an object of the free coproduct
completion `Fam(Card)` — becomes the presheaf `famPresheaf U d`, the coproduct
of representables `Σ_u y(d u)`. The p.r.a. formula then reads the functor's
value at that presheaf off the arity homs, and `arityHomEquiv` computes them:
an arity hom for the shape at a code former is a choice, for each generic
direction `k`, of a code `u` together with a morphism `bound k ⟶ d u`.

That morphism is where the two presentations part. The inductive-recursive
presentation of the same universe
(`Geb/Mathlib/Data/PFunctor/IndRec/Universes.lean`) works over `Type` treated as
discrete, so its corresponding datum is an equality: the bound code's decoding
*is* the declared object. Over a base with morphisms the equality relaxes to a
coercion, and `junkArity` exhibits a consequence: a binder shape declaring the
empty object accepts a code denoting the singleton. Since a shape's output index
is fixed by the shape (`out_emptyBind`), the code so formed decodes by its
declaration rather than by its children — the recursion of induction-recursion
is decoupled.

The relaxation is not a defect of the encoding but the price of functoriality.
`piFormer_not_covariant` reproduces, at this scale, the obstruction of Example
3.6 of [GhaniNordvallForsbergMalatesta2015]: the dependent-product former admits
no covariant action on the base's morphisms, while `sigmaFormer_covariant` shows
the dependent-sum former does at the same instance. The universe functor of
`Basic` is nonetheless total in the type former — `sigmaUniverse` and
`piUniverse` differ only in the shape-output map — precisely because the
declared decoding it carries is not required to match the decodings of its
children.

## Main definitions

* `famPresheaf` — a family of codes as a presheaf, the coproduct of
  representables `Σ_u y(d u)`.
* `arityHomEquiv` — the arity homs into such a presheaf: one code and one
  coercion per generic direction.
* `oneFam` / `emptyBindCode` / `junkShape` / `junkArity` / `junkObj` — the family
  with one code denoting the singleton, the binder code declaring the empty
  object, and the element of the functor's value that binds the one against the
  other.
* `counterFam` / `counterMap` / `counterFamReindexed` — the data of Example 3.6.

## Main statements

* `junk_decoding_ne` — the bound code's decoding differs from the object the
  shape declares, so the arity hom has no inductive-recursive counterpart.
* `out_emptyBind` — the shape's output object is fixed by the declaration.
* `sigmaFormer_covariant` / `piFormer_not_covariant` — Example 3.6 at this
  scale.

/-! ## Families as presheaves -/

/-- A family of codes as a presheaf: the coproduct of representables
`Σ_u y(d u)`. This is the embedding of the free coproduct completion `Fam(Card)`
into `PSh(Card)`; its fiber over `c` is not the codes decoding to `c` but the
codes admitting a morphism from `c`. -/
def famPresheaf (U : Type) (d : U → Card) : Cardᵒᵖ ⥤ Type where
  obj c := Σ u : U, (c.unop ⟶ d u)
  map f := ↾ fun x ↦ (⟨x.1, f.unop ≫ x.2⟩ : Σ u : U, (_ ⟶ d u))
  map_id _ := rfl
  map_comp _ _ := rfl

/-! ## The arity homs -/

/-- The arity homs into a family presheaf: an arity hom for the shape `a` is a
choice, for each generic direction `k`, of a code `u` together with a morphism
`bound k ⟶ d u`. Forward is evaluation at the generic directions and backward is
precomposition, the two round trips being Yoneda.

The morphism is the point of the computation. The inductive-recursive
presentation over a discrete base has an equality `bound k = d u` here; over a
base with morphisms no arity can ask for that, since a direction constrains the
index of the value it receives and the index of a value in a family presheaf is
not its code's decoding. -/
def arityHomEquiv (former : Former) (a : Shp former) (U : Type) (d : U → Card) :
    ArityHom (universeFunctor former) a (famPresheaf U d) ≃
      ((k : Idx a.1) → Σ u : U, (bound a.1 k ⟶ d u)) where
  toFun α k := α.1 (bound a.1 k) ⟨⟨k, bound a.1 k, 𝟙 _⟩, rfl⟩
  invFun F :=
    ⟨fun _i b ↦ ⟨(F b.1.1).1, (eqToHom b.2.symm ≫ b.1.2.2) ≫ (F b.1.1).2⟩,

/-- An arity hom for `junkShape` binding the single code of `oneFam`: the
generic direction asks for a morphism `⟨0⟩ ⟶ ⟨1⟩`, which the empty function
supplies, where the inductive-recursive presentation would demand `⟨1⟩ = ⟨0⟩`.
The second generic direction family is empty. -/

/-! ## Example 3.6 at this scale

The obstruction to interpreting the dependent-product universe over a base with
morphisms: reindexing the family along a morphism of the bound object must act
covariantly on the former's output. -/

/-- The morphism of the counterexample: the unique map from the empty object to
the singleton. -/

/-- The counterexample's family reindexed along that morphism. -/
def counterFamReindexed : El ⟨0⟩ → Card := fun i ↦ counterFam (counterMap i)

/-- The dependent-sum former acts covariantly at the counterexample: both sides
are the empty object. -/
theorem sigmaFormer_covariant :
    Nonempty (sigmaFormer ⟨0⟩ counterFamReindexed ⟶ sigmaFormer ⟨1⟩ counterFam) :=
  ⟨fun i ↦ i.elim0⟩

/-- The dependent-product former does not: the empty product is the singleton
and the product of the counterexample family is empty, and there is no map from
the singleton to the empty object. This is Example 3.6 of
[GhaniNordvallForsbergMalatesta2015] at the smallest scale that hosts it. -/
