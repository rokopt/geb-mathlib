# Ranked alphabets and their term algebras

A ranked alphabet names finitely many symbols, each with an arity and each
spelled by a block of bits of one common width. Its term algebra is the W-type
of the finitary polynomial functor whose shape type is `Fin card` and whose
direction family sends a symbol to `Fin` of its arity, so that all recursion
over terms is carried by `WType.elim` and `WType.rec`.

The unlabelled binary trees of `Data/Tree/Binary.lean` are the terms of the
alphabet of one symbol of arity zero and one of arity two.

## Main definitions

* `RankedAlphabet` — the alphabet.
* `RankedAlphabet.Term` — the term algebra.
* `RankedAlphabet.Term.mk` — the constructor, at the alphabet's own arities.
* `RankedAlphabet.Term.size` — the number of nodes.

## Main statements

* `RankedAlphabet.Term.induction` — induction in the `Term.mk` presentation.
* `RankedAlphabet.size_le_sum_ofFn` — a child's node count is at most the sum
  over the children.

## Implementation notes

`width_pos` is required rather than decorative. It is what gives
`t.size ≤ (spell t).length`, the fuel `Data/Tree/Ranked/Preorder.lean`'s
descent consumes, through `t.size ≤ width * t.size`; at width zero every
block is empty, so a one-symbol alphabet spells its unique term by the empty
word while the validity scan rejects that word, and the encoding is no
longer a bijection onto the words it accepts.

`Term` is `@[expose]`, as `BinTree` is: without it `WType.mk` applications
against `Fin (R.arity i)` do not elaborate across the module boundary.

`Term.mk` exists because `WType.mk` at a concrete alphabet presents a child
family at type `Fin (R.arity ⟨v, h⟩)`, which is not syntactically `Fin 0` at
a nullary symbol; naming the constructor lets a caller write the arity once.
It is applied as `Term.mk R i ch` rather than `R.Term.mk i ch`: generalized
field notation resolves `R.Term` first, and that is a `Type`, which carries
no `mk`.
