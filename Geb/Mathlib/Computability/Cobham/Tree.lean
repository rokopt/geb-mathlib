# The preorder stack scan in Cobham's class

An expression of `C` computing, in a single right-to-left pass over a
bitstring, the stack depth of the word read as the preorder spelling of a
binary tree, together with the verdict of `BinTree.ok`. The two are carried in
one recursive value, told apart by its head: while no node bit has been read
below depth two the value is the depth in unary offset by one, so its head is
`true`; once one has been, the value is `[false]`, which the node step
reproduces, that value's two predecessors being empty. Each bit is read once.

The recursion is a `boundedRec` node, so admissibility requires a bound: the
scan's value is never longer than the recursion variable by more than one bit,
which the successor `S₁` expresses as a term of arity one. That is the side
condition of bounded recursion on notation [Cobham1965], and discharging it is
what places the scan in `C` rather than merely in the syntax `sig` describes.

The one-test on the scan's predecessor is the recognizer, correct against the
`Valid` predicate of the encoding. Composed with
`BinTree.valid_iff_exists_print`, `isTreeSem_eq_singleton_iff_exists_print`
states that an expression of `C` accepts exactly the spellings of trees, and
`isTreeSem_eq_ite` pins its value on the rejecting branch as well, so the
correctness is a property of the function and not only of the accepted set.

## Main definitions

* `Cobham.zeroAt`, `Cobham.oneAt`, `Cobham.falseAt` — the empty bitstring and
  the one-bit strings `[true]` and `[false]`, at an arbitrary arity.
* `Cobham.inc` — prepending `true`, of arity one.
* `Cobham.predPred` — the argument with two bits dropped, of arity one.
* `Cobham.combFalseStep`, `Cobham.combTrueStep` — the leaf step and the node
  step of the scan, of arity two.
* `Cobham.comb` — the stack depth and the underflow verdict in one value, of
  arity one.
* `Cobham.eqOne` — whether a bitstring has length one, of arity one.
* `Cobham.isTree` — the recognizer, of arity one.
* `Cobham.combSem`, `Cobham.eqOneSem`, `Cobham.isTreeSem` — the meaning of
  each of the three at its arity, over which every statement of the module
  is stated.

Each expression appears in three tiers: a raw tree `…Raw`, the expression `…`
of `C` carrying admissibility, and the ascription `…Of` at its reduced arity.

## Main statements

* `Cobham.combSem_nil`, `Cobham.combSem_cons_false`,
  `Cobham.combSem_cons_true` — the scan unfolded at each constructor of the
  recursion variable, with the recursive value exposed.
* `Cobham.combSem_eq` — the scan computes `BinTree.depth` in unary, offset by
  one, while `BinTree.ok` holds, and `[false]` once it has failed.
* `Cobham.eqOneSem_eq` — `eqOne` accepts exactly the bitstrings of length
  one.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_apply` — one step of the recognizer: the one-test on
  the scan's predecessor.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_eq_ite` — the recognizer's value on both branches:
  `[true]` on a word satisfying `BinTree.Valid` and `[]` on every other.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_eq_singleton_iff_valid` — `isTree` accepts exactly the
  words satisfying `BinTree.Valid`.
* `Cobham.isTreeSem_eq_singleton_iff_exists_print` — equivalently, exactly
  the spellings of trees.

## Implementation notes

Each raw tree is named apart from the expression built on it because instance
search finds `Decidable (sig.WValid w)` when `w` is a constant but not when it
is a literal `WType.mk` application, so `decide` discharges admissibility only
of a named tree. `zeroAtRaw`, `oneAtRaw` and `falseAtRaw` carry a free arity,
at which `decide` does not apply; their admissibility is the pair of an
`Unit ⊕ Fin m` case analysis and the `funext` that the index condition asks
for. The admissibility of an expression embedding `pred` or `cond` reuses that
expression's own component rather than repeating its proof.

`combSem` is the meaning read at the raw tree rather than at `comb`.
`Cobham.eval` asks only for admissibility as a `sig`-tree, not for the
recursion bound, so the scan is characterized by `combSem_eq` before the
expression carrying that bound exists. The bound is then that characterization
together with `BinTree.depth_le_length`: the value is `[false]`, of length one,
or the depth in unary offset by one, and the depth never exceeds the word
length, while the bound child `S₁` returns one bit more than the recursion
variable. Reading `comb` back through `C.eval` returns `combSem`, both being
the same transport along `fst_eval`.

`cond` and `pred` are `boundedRec` nodes in this algebra rather than
generators, so a step's meaning reduces only once the value it scrutinizes is
in constructor form: `combSem_cons_false` and `combSem_cons_true` are therefore
not definitional, and each is proved by rewriting the scan to the step's own
application at the recursive value, generalizing that value, and matching on
it. The node step's guard drops two bits through two `pred` nodes, each of
which peels a bit only at a literal, so the match reaches the fourth
constructor layer of the value.

`combSem` names the meaning at the reduced arity, so that rewriting under it
type-checks. A meaning taken through the `Sigma` projection instead has a type
headed by that projection rather than by an arrow, and `rw` under it fails as
not type-correct at `implicit` transparency.

`eqOne` and `isTree` are `comp` compositions of `pred`, `cond` and `comb`,
carrying no `boundedRec` node of their own, so each admissibility obligation
is discharged by `recBounded_mk` over the node's children, reusing the
embedded subexpression's own `RecBounded` component rather than repeating its
proof. Unlike a primitive predecessor shape, `pred` here is itself a
`boundedRec` node (`predRaw`), so its value on the scan's result does not
reduce on a symbolic word: `isTreeSem_apply` is proved, as
`combSem_cons_false` and `combSem_cons_true` are, by rewriting to the
composition's own application, generalizing the scan's value, and matching
on it, rather than by `rfl`.
