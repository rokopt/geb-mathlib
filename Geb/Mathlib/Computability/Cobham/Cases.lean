# Definition by cases over Cobham's class

A combinator selecting among `2 ^ p` expressions of arity one by the low `p`
bits of a scrutinee, and applying the selected one to a second argument. It
imposes no condition on the expressions it selects among; `Cobham.cases`'s
docstring records why.

## Main definitions

* `Cobham.bits` — the bits of a scrutinee word, `false` past its end.
* `Cobham.shiftRaw`, `Cobham.shiftW` — a tree of arity two at the predecessor
  of argument zero.
* `Cobham.casesRaw`, `Cobham.casesW`, `Cobham.casesSem` — the case tree, its
  admissible form, and its meaning.
* `Cobham.cases`, `Cobham.casesOf` — the case tree as an expression of `C`, and
  at its declared arity.

## Main statements

* `Cobham.bits_succ`, `Cobham.bits_succ_tail`, `Cobham.bits_ofFn`,
  `Cobham.ofFn_bits` — peeling, dropping, and the round trip against
  `List.ofFn`. `ofFn_bits` recovers the scrutinee, truncated and zero-padded,
  from the family its bits spell.
* `Cobham.wValid_casesRaw`, `Cobham.recBounded_casesW` — admissibility and the
  recursion bound, from the branches' own.
* `Cobham.semAt_shiftW`, `Cobham.casesSem_eq`, `Cobham.casesSem_eq_eval` — the
  shift's meaning, the branch the scrutinee selects, and the identification
  with the meaning the expression carries.
* `Cobham.stepWord_predIterOf`, `Cobham.stepWord_prependOf`,
  `Cobham.baseWord_prependOf`, `Cobham.baseWord_constAtOf`,
  `Cobham.stepWord_constAtOf`, `Cobham.stepWord_diagOf` — the words the
  combinators of `Cobham/Basic.lean` contribute.

## Implementation notes

The scrutinee is consumed by shifting it into the recursive subtree rather than
by scrutinising an iterated predecessor of a fixed argument. At an iterated
predecessor the scrutinee is not a variable, so no case analysis reduces the
`boundedRec` node of `cond` and the semantic theorem is unreachable; shifting
leaves the scrutinee as argument zero itself. It is also linear rather than
quadratic in the number of bits dispatched on.

`cond`'s empty branch is directed at the same subtree as its head-`false`
branch, which reads a scrutinee shorter than `p` as zero-padded and keeps
`casesSem_eq` free of a hypothesis.

`ofFn_bits` is proved by structural induction on the width. The route through
`List.ext_getElem` and `omega` depends on `Classical.choice`.

The six word characterisations are stated here rather than beside the
definitions they characterise, `baseWord` and `stepWord` being declared in
`Cobham/Scan.lean`, which imports `Cobham/Basic.lean`.
